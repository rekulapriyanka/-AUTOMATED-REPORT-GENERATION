Automated Report Generation is the process of automatically collecting, processing, and presenting data in a structured report format without the need for manual intervention. These reports can be generated on a scheduled basis (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), triggered by events, or requested on demand.Automated report generation is the process of using technology to collect, process, and present data in structured report formats—such as PDFs, Excel files, or dashboards—without manual effort. 

This task typically involves integrating various data sources like SQL/NoSQL databases, APIs, spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets), cloud data warehouses (such as Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, or Snowflake), and even flat files like CSV. To extract and manipulate data, developers often use programming languages like Python, R, or JavaScript, along with powerful libraries and frameworks. 

In Python, libraries such as pandas are used for data cleaning and analysis, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for data visualization, and jinja2 combined with pdfkit or WeasyPrint for generating HTML-based PDF reports. Excel reports can be created using libraries like openpyxl or xlsxwriter.
